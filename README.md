My Portfolio

  I've recently finished my Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp and am determined to put it all into practice. My first undertaking has been building my own
personal portfolio so that I can begin applying for junior dev positions/find some freelance work on the side.

  I've chosen to try and complete this site using only basic HTML, CSS, and JS. I've made this decision so that I can try and ground my own understanding of the 
fundamentals. I've worked with several frameworks and libraries and plan on building more sites utilizing them, but for now, I'd like to revisit the start of my lessons
in a fun but meaningful way!
